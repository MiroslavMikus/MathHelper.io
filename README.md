# MathHelper.io
This is a math nuget package used to simplify a lot of mathematical operations and formulas

1. IsOdd - checks if a number is odd or not
2. IsEven - checks if a number is even or not
3. IsPrime - checks if a number is prime or not
4. Add - adds two numbers. Ex: 2.Add(3) = 5
5. Sum - adds a list of numbers. Ex: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.Sum() = 55
6. Substract - substracts two numbers. Ex: 7.Subsctract(10) = -3
7. Average - find the average of multiple numbers.
8. WeightedAverage - finds the average using the weights of respective values
