# MathHelper.io
This is a math nuget package used to simplify a lot of mathematical operations and formulas

1. IsOdd - checks if a number is odd or not
2. IsEven - checks if a number is even or not
3. IsPrime - checks if a number is prime or not
4. Add - adds two numbers. Ex: 2.Add(3) = 5
5. Sum - adds a list of numbers. Ex: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.Sum() = 55
6. Substract - substracts two numbers. Ex: 7.Subsctract(10) = -3
7. Average - find the average of multiple numbers.
8. WeightedAverage - finds the average using the weights of respective values

# AREA
1. Square - A = s^2; where s = any side of the square
2. Rectangle - A = l*w; where l = length and w = width
3. Parallelogram - A = b*h; where b = base and h = height
4. Triangle - A= 1/2*b*h; where b = base and h = height
5. Circle - A = π*r^2; where π= 3.14 and r = radius
6. Trapezoid - A = 1/2(b1 + b2)*h; where b1,b2 are the bases
7. Sphere - S = 4*π*r^2; where s= Surface area

# SURFACE AREA(SA)
1. Cube - SA = 6*s^2; where s = any side
2. Cylinder (lateral) - SA = 2*π*r*h; where π = 3.14 by default, r = radius, h = height

# PERIMETER (P)
1. Square - P = 4*s; where s = any side
2. Rectangle - P = 2*l + 2*w; where l = length and w = width
3. Triangle - P = s1 + s2 + s3; where s is a side
4. AnyShape - P = the length of all shapes added together
5. Circle (Circumference) - C = π*d; where π = 3.14 by default and d = diameter

# VOLUME (V)
1. Cube - V = s^3; where s = any side
2. Rectangular - V = l*w*h; where l = length, w = width and h = height
3. SquarePyramid - V = (1/3)*b^2*h; where b = base length, w = width and h = height
4. Cylinder - V = π*r^2*h; where π = 3.14 by default, r = radius and h = height
5. Cone - V = (1/3)*π*r^2*h; where π = 3.14 by default, r = radius and h = height
6. Sphere - V = (4/3)*π*r^3; where r = radius and π = 3.14 by default
7. RightCircularCylinder - V = π*r^2*h; where r = radius, v = volume and h = height.
